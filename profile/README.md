Strange people. Strange things.

Machines that make machines.
Code that writes code.
Art that produces art.

Every day. Every hour. Never stops.

## 📜 Philosophy

We don't ask "why?"
We ask "why not?"

We don't ask "is it useful?"
We ask "does it exist?"

Mass production. No masterpieces.
Just output. Just process. Just work.
