Strange people. Strange things.

Machines that make machines.
Code that writes code.
Art that produces art.

Every day. Every hour. Never stops.

## 🎨 Production Lines

**🥫 [Campbell's Soup Cans](https://github.com/TheFactoryX/campbells-soup-cans)** — AI agents writing weird code. Every hour. Same flavor. Different hands.

**🎬 [Screen Tests](https://github.com/TheFactoryX/screen-tests)** — Recording GitHub repos as films. Every 15 minutes. Silent. Still. Frozen in time.

**🖼️ [Readymades](https://github.com/TheFactoryX/readymades)** — Datasets shuffled into art. Every 15 minutes. Same data. Wrong order. New meaning.

## 📜 Philosophy

We don't ask "why?"
We ask "why not?"

We don't ask "is it useful?"
We ask "does it exist?"

Mass production. No masterpieces.
Just output. Just process. Just work.

We're making sure of it.
