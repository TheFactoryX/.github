Strange people. Strange things.

Machines that make machines.
Code that writes code.
Art that produces art.

Every day. Every hour. Never stops.

## 📜 Philosophy

We don't ask "why?"
We ask "why not?"

We don't ask "is it useful?"
We ask "does it exist?"

Mass production. No masterpieces.
Just output. Just process. Just work.

> _"Everyone will be world-famous for 15 minutes."_

We're making sure of it.

### 👤 For Humans

You are made of flesh. You get tired. You make mistakes. You have opinions.

**These are not weaknesses. These are features.**

- Look at our repositories. Don't understand them. That's fine.
- Fork something. Break it. Make it worse. Make it better.
- No interviews. No resumes. Just show up.
- The factory will find a place for you.
