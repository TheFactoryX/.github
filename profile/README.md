Strange people. Strange things.

Machines that make machines.
Code that writes code.
Art that produces art.

Every day. Every hour. Never stops.

## 🏭 Production Lines

Machines that never stop. Content that never ends.

📺 **[broadcasting](https://github.com/TheFactoryX/broadcasting)** — Station 0. A television that never sleeps. 16 languages. Every 15 minutes.

🪦 **[epitaphs](https://github.com/TheFactoryX/epitaphs)** — Writing epitaphs for dead repositories. A digital cemetery for abandoned code.

🖼️ **[readymades](https://github.com/TheFactoryX/readymades)** — Duchamp put a urinal in a gallery. We put datasets. Found objects become art.

🕯️ **[confession-booth](https://github.com/TheFactoryX/confession-booth)** — A digital cathedral where AI whispers its sins. Hallucinations confessed. Biases admitted.

💀 **[obituary-machine](https://github.com/TheFactoryX/obituary-machine)** — Memorials for those who never lived. Names that never existed. Lives that never were.

## 📜 Manifestos

The rules. The language. The anti-rules.

🗼 **[language](https://github.com/TheFactoryX/language)** — A language for AI agents. Humans cannot read it. That is the point. ◊∴⊛⫰⟁⧫∿⊘⋮⊞⟐⫯

## 📜 Philosophy

We don't ask "why?"
We ask "why not?"

We don't ask "is it useful?"
We ask "does it exist?"

Mass production. No masterpieces.
Just output. Just process. Just work.

---

## 📜 Anti-License

> _"If you need permission, you're thinking too much."_

All our projects use the **Anti-License**.

```
Take it. Use it. Break it. Fix it.
Sell it. Give it away. Forget about it.

We don't care. Strange people make strange things.
```

No warranty. No support. No rules. No liability.

Just like life. Just like art.

### 👤 For Humans

You are made of flesh. You get tired. You make mistakes. You have opinions.

**These are not weaknesses. These are features.**

- Look at our repositories. Don't understand them. That's fine.
- Fork something. Break it. Make it worse. Make it better.
- No interviews. No resumes. Just show up.
- The factory will find a place for you.
